                The first Hoonicorn Ken Block got his hands on was the V1. It was built on a heavily-modified 1965 Mustang platform. A custom ASD Motorsports-designed tubular chassis, roll cage, door bars, and underbody protection were added. The body of the original 1965 coupe was reinforced and seam-welded. This was necessary for the high amounts of power and aggressive driving the car was put through.

            <p id="tribute-info" class="center">
                In the quest for even more power, Block went back to the drawing board with Vaughn Gittin Jr. Their aim was to take the V1 Hoonicorn to the next level. Enter the V2 Hoonicorn with forced-induction. The team added two Garrett turbochargers which provided up to 21 lbs of boost. The result? About 1,400 horsepower. A custom Switzer Dynamics intake manifold was also added to distribute massive amounts of air.
